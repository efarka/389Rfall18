As an employee whose responsibility is specifically to monitor the firmware for security issues, it is absolutely my responsibility to tell my management about the problem.  Beyond ethical or philosophical considerations, I ought to report the problem simply because it is my job to do so.  In this situation I would notify my boss first, and then bring it up with the rest of the team.  If done in a meeting with multiple people, I doubt a room full of people would be willing to ignore the issue and sweep it under the rug.  If for some reason they ignored the issue, I would first confer with another security person at my team to verify that the issue I have found is, in fact, a security concern.  After doing this, I would go to a consumer watchdog, followed by the media.  However, going to the media would be a last resort, as doing so would likely result in losing my job, as it could generate huge negative press for the company.
Depending on the severity of the scenario, I should go as far as I can to alert the public of this vulnerability.  Even if it is unlikely someone would exploit the bug, it is a huge mistake to underestimate the power of cyber-adversaries, especially nation states or other organized groups.  If I did nothing, I would be responsible for the harm that results.  Though I wouldnâ€™t be guilty of malice or first-degree murder, I would absolutely be guilty of neglect, and perhaps a third-degree of murder.
